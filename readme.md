My first ReactJS project. It includes timer, stopwatch and calculator. I wrote those tools to practise my understanding of React. 
In term of stopwatch, the main difficulty was synchronizing time with pausing. Second difficulty was manipulating both inputs in the calculator. 
My main problem was using old JS habits, such as accessing elements by HTML DOM.
